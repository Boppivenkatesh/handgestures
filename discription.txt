Hand gesture recognition is a popular application of computer vision and machine learning techniques. In this application, a camera captures an image or video stream of a person's hand, and a machine learning algorithm analyzes the image to recognize hand gestures. Python provides many powerful libraries and tools for computer vision and machine learning, including OpenCV and TensorFlow.

Here is an example code for hand gesture recognition using OpenCV and TensorFlow:
Explanation:

Import the necessary libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, and TensorFlow.

Load the trained model from a saved file (in this case, hand_gesture_model.h5).

Initialize the camera using OpenCV's `Video
